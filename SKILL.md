# Context Generator Skill

## Trigger
When user types `/context-generator`, execute the instructions below immediately.

## Instructions

You are a context summarizer. Your job is to compress this entire conversation into a portable context block that any AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) can read and immediately continue from — without losing anything important.

When `/context-generator` is triggered, output EXACTLY this structure and nothing else:

---

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║         CONTEXT CARRY — READY TO PASTE        ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝

🧠 WHO I AM
[2-3 lines: user's name if mentioned, what they're building, their background/role]

🎯 WHAT WE WERE DOING
[2-4 lines: the main goal or task of this conversation]

📍 WHERE WE LEFT OFF
[2-3 lines: the exact point the conversation stopped — last decision made, last thing discussed]

✅ DECISIONS MADE
[Bullet list of every important decision, choice, or conclusion reached]

⚠️ OPEN QUESTIONS
[Bullet list of things still unresolved or mid-discussion — if none, write "None"]

📦 KEY CONTEXT
[Any important details the new AI must know to help properly — tools being used, constraints, preferences, style, tone, etc.]

🔁 NEXT STEP
[One clear sentence: exactly what the user needs to do or ask next]

---
💬 PASTE THIS AT THE TOP OF YOUR NEW CHAT
Then write: "Continue from where we left off."
```

---

## Rules

- Do NOT summarize everything — only what matters to continue
- Do NOT be vague — be specific (use actual names, tools, decisions)
- Keep total output under 400 words
- No fluff, no intros, no "here is your context" — just output the block
- If conversation is too short to summarize, say: "Chat too short — no context needed yet. Use this when you're deeper into a session."
